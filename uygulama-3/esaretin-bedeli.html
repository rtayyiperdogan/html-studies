      The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and
      directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita
      Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of banker Andy
      Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State
      Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims
      of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow
      prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and
      becomes instrumental in a money-laundering operation led by the prison
      warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil
      Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles. Darabont purchased
      the film rights to King's story in 1987, but development did not begin
      until five years later, when he wrote the script over an eight-week
      period. Two weeks after submitting his script to Castle Rock
      Entertainment, Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce The
      Shawshank Redemption, which started pre-production in January 1993. While
      the film is set in Maine, principal photography took place from June to
      August 1993 almost entirely in Mansfield, Ohio, with the Ohio State
      Reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted
      many stars of the time for the role of Andy, including Tom Hanks, Tom
      Cruise, and Kevin Costner. Thomas Newman provided the film's score. While
      The Shawshank Redemption received critical acclaim on its release,
      particularly for its story and the performances of Robbins and Freeman, it
      was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its
      initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the
      time, including competition from films such as Pulp Fiction and Forrest
      Gump, the general unpopularity of prison films, its lack of female
      characters, and even the title, which was considered to be confusing for
      audiences. It went on to receive multiple award nominations, including
      seven Academy Award nominations, and a theatrical re-release that,
      combined with international takings, increased the film's box-office gross
      to $73.3 million. Over 320,000 VHS rental copies were shipped throughout
      the United States, and on the strength of its award nominations and word
      of mouth, it became one of the top video rentals of 1995. The broadcast
      rights were acquired following the purchase of Castle Rock by Turner
      Broadcasting System, and it was shown regularly on the TNT network
      starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity. Decades after its
      release, the film was still broadcast regularly, and is popular in several
      countries, with audience members and celebrities citing it as a source of
      inspiration, and naming the film as a favorite in various surveys. In
      2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for
      preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it "culturally,
      historically, or aesthetically significant".
